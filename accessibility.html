			<h1>Accessibility</h1>

For evaluating the accessibility aspect of our website, we used common sense,
in combination with a couple of accessibility test tools from https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/. 
These tests were used to check and confirm that our website is properly designed with accessibility in mind. 
The first test we did was to check if our website was compliable to people with disabilities. Here we used both an automated test, 
and a manual test where we tried to navigate us all around the website just using the keyboard. From the test results we got a score of 93+% 
of the different pages from the automated one, which seemed good enough. And for the manual test we could not seem to find any serious issues with the navigation,
and therefore did not change anything.

The second test we did was a Color Contrast Accessibility Validator, which checks color-based problems like contrasts. This was also an automated test, 
and the result we got back was positive. In other words did the colors of the website work together nicely, like seen in the image below. 
				
The last test with did, was to check the code for validation. For the css-part of the website the automated test showed no errors. However,
it did find a good amount of errors connected to the html-part. Therefore, we had to check the importance of every error, and manually change the code
according to the error which was found.

When it came to the universal design part, there was not really a simple test we could do, beside compare the principals of universal design to our website,
or have a little user test. So that is what we did. Beside what we have talked about already, we think the design of the website feel/look-wise is intuitive, 
simple, and efficient. So, summed up we believe it has the basics of universal design. This statement would be pretty subjective, so therefore we showed the 
final product to family and friends. As boring as it is, they pretty much came to the same conclusion, and as a consequence of that, we did not change the 
website a lot.

After these tests and a thorough examination of the Front-End development, we would agree that the accessibility aspect of our website was like we wanted it 
to be. In other words, that the user could interact, navigate, get information, and perceive/feel the website as nice and easy.
