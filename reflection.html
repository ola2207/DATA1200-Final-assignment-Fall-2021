			<h2>Reflection essay</h2>

			<h1>Becoming a student</h1>

				This semester I have started studying for the first time, and this has
				changed my life drastically, in many different ways.
			</p>

			<h3>Work</h3>

				When transitioning from upper-secondary school to university, the biggest
				challenge I experienced was having to do most of my schoolwork on my own.
				Being a student rather than a pupil means. But what I learned was more fun
				and more engaging than in school, and when I started to understand the
				basics the rest made more sense. Also, having my friends review my work
				helped me both see how to do things better and how far I had actually come.
			</p>

			<h3>Moving out</h3>

			/>
			<p id="ref-p">Before I started my semester I moved out from my parents house, to an apartment with some of my friends.
It was one of the most stressful things I have done, and just living without my parents' help was scary in the beginning.
After a few weeks though, I had settled into my new life and it stopped being scary and was just fun. Deciding everything myself is still a bit stressful, though. Like having to come up with dinner ideas or what to buy or what to do when we face a problem in our apartment.</p>

			<h3>Finding groups</h3>

				alt="grupperom"
			/>
			<p id="ref-p">
The amount of zoom classes and on-your-own work really stressed me out at the start of the semester. I felt like I was never doing enough studying and it was hard to motivate myself. But after getting to know more people in class and through group projects, I was working less and less alone. My focus shifted away from all I had to learn and to the assignments we had to do, and then I learned what I needed through them. Also planning to work together at school helped my motivation tremendously. Saying to someone that you are going to meet up and work makes me feel more obligated than if i am just obligated to myself.</p>

			<h3>Freedom</h3>
			<img
				id="reflection-img"
				src="images/reflection/IMG_1030.jpg"
				alt="sila og mikro"
			/>
			<p id="ref-p">Even though being a student and moving out has given me a lot more responsibility, it has also given me a lot of freedom. I have to manage my money, but I can also put whatever I want whenever I want in my apartment. Like when my friends and I bought a miko oven, just because we saw it on sale. I also have to manage my time, but even though i need to put enough time into my job and studying, i can do whatever i want whenever i want. I can take a free day from studying because my friend is only in Oslo for a day so i can show them around, or i can buy tickets to a trip to Trondheim without having to ask anyone else first.
Even though i have been faced with new challenges, student life suits me well, and i am looking forward to a new semester of learning cool things, working with nice people and living with my friends.</p>
